                    This summer I visited Sydney, Austrailia for the first time! It was super cool and fun, so much so that I'm going back next winter for study abroad! I'm super excited, and wanted to share all the unique things there are to do there. One thing I loved the most was the shopping and all the fashion! When walking around Sydney downtown, it can be a little overwhelming because all the shopping is hidden in arcade malls and small alleyways lead you to amazing buildings. Here are my top recommendations for your visit:
                </p>

The building itself is a masterpiece, showcasing Romanesque architecture. Inside, you'll find an array of luxury boutiques, international brands, and unique Australian designers. From high-end fashion to exquisite accessories, the QVB is a must-visit for a luxurious shopping experience.
